## Status: Alpha

We are working to create a stable version that can be used in real projects, we are currently working on the documentation and the creation of components to have at least the amount of the v3
**vuesax 4** is fully created from 0 and therefore each component and new functionality is worked in its entirety which takes time

The central team is working on the priority that is to create new components and verify that they do not have the bugs or problems of the previous version so we gain a better development and more complete components
